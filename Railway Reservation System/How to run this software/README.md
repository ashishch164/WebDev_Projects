1. First of all download php files and images from this repository and store them in one file folder ,lets called it as "RRS" and do not create any folders in it like admin,customer,img or staff. I created in repo only just to look well managed. </br></br>
2. Install xampp server in your computer and then in htdocs folder in xampp folder, paste this whole RRS folder. </br>
3. Then start your xampp server from xampp control panel. </br>
4. After that open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser and create a new database and named it as "DB" (Remember: it must be in capital form).</br>
5. Then create 7 tables and named it as "admin", "customer","staff","login","pnr","train","history".(Remember:this must be in small letters and do not add quotes in it,that quotes  is just to mention table names properly and same applies for "DB" also).</br>
6. Here your database will look like:
